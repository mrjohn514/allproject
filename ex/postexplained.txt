step 1: we have created post collection with postshema(createed post.js model)

steps 2 :we have created  a form in views so that user can post from there

step 3 : then setup the post controller in which we just populated the post collection with info from 
post form that we recieve

step 4 setup the route for this controller (created post.js in routes and mapped the controller)


step 5 i want to show post in the homepage so going to homecontroller and passing the post collection docuemnet
to my views and using them in views \
module.exports.home=function(req,res){

Post.find({},function(err,posts){

    if(err){console.log("erro");return};

    return res.render('home_page',{
        title:'home',
        posts:posts
        });

})

}
then using posts in view home.ejs


step 6 now i also want to show the name of user who had done post 
but my post.user field only conatain only user id(user:adfkjdfoinvdoihndv) so i need to populate this user field with whole
user object form user collection using populate method before passing it to views 

//findin all the posts and pouplating user field of each post
Post.find({}).populate('user').exec(function(req,res){             //previously we are writting callback fxn along side with finding query
                                                         //what here as we are populating also we put callback in exec fxn
        if(err){console.log("erro");return};

    return res.render('home_page',{
        title:'home',
        posts:posts         
        });
})


puting user in views

step 7  now i want to restrict those users from posting which are not loggedin 
so i can do this by only providing posting forms to those who have signed in and not to all 

1 :first check not showing forms to unsigned users
    <div class="content">
        <h1>codeial/homepage</h1>
        <%if(locals.user){%>          
        <form action="/post/createpost" method="post">
            <textarea name="content"  cols="30" rows="3"></textarea>
            <input type="submit" value="post">
            <%}%>
    </div>


 // if i use (   <%if(user){%> ) then there will be error "user is not defined"
 so simply user is not been able to fetch from locals now locals is an object 
 and if i just refer to locals and ask if this key is present if(locals.user)   //present or not in locals 

locals= {
user:user_id
 
} 

2nd check : now if someone knows html they will jsut inspect element and edit and create a form 
if they know our filds and setting the route 
so to avoid this  that we put at check controller/action level
that no one other than who are signin are able to make post  so we use passport.checkauthentication in controller of createpost

router.post('/createpost',passport.checkAuthentication,postController.createpost);

so now when a request of localhost/post/createpost came before going to postController.createpost
first it will be authencicated using passport function
