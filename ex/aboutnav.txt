<header>

    <div class="navbar">
      <h1>codeal</h1>
    </div>
</header>

-------------------css----------------
.navbar{
    height: 55px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    background: linear-gradient(104deg, rgba(45,44,46,1) 11%, rgba(127,126,130,1) 86%, rgba(1,15,19,1) 99%);
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;;
}


but here navbar will not stick to top as div is insde the heaader and is not working 
but if we remove the header tag from html 
 <div class="navbar">
      <h1>codeal</h1>
    </div>
    then above css will work normalluy navbar will stick to top 



----------------------------------------what we can also do------------
header{
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;;
}

.navbar{
    height: 55px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    background: linear-gradient(104deg, rgba(45,44,46,1) 11%, rgba(127,126,130,1) 86%, rgba(1,15,19,1) 99%);
}












----basically what happening is div is inside the header and it is not moving up so threshold top=0 will not
occur as onluy header conntanier is moving so we have to apply sticky to that container that is hitting threshold top =0;
