step 1: creating action/controller for deleing a post  
created deltepost controller in postcontroller

module.exports.deletepost=function(req,res)
{
//first check if post is there in db or not so we find in db the postid we received from string params 
Post.findById(req.params.id,function(err,post){

//if post is there 
//next check if iam allowed to delete the post found can any random pereson can delte my post no so 
//user who made the post is only authorise to delte
//initilaly post.user is only id unntill i populate it 

if(post.user==req.user.id){     //ideally i have to write req.user._id but whenever iam comparing ids of two objects
                                  //i need to convert them into string so mongoose give me automatic varient of that (.id)
                                //.id means converting object id into string type automatically                                      

post.remove();

//now i also have to delete comments associaed with post
Comment.deleteMany({post:req.params.id},function(err){      //post field of Comment collection == req.params.id
if(err){console.log("erro in comnt deleting ");return}

return res.redirect('/');

})

}

//if user not match 
else
{
    return res.redirect('/');
}

})
}


step 2 :creating route for deltepost controller in routes post.js
router.get('/deletepost/:id',passport.checkAuthentication,postController.deletepost);

step 3: now creating buutton for deletion  of post in views 
now that button should be visivle only when user is sign in and only to the user which is signedin  

checks:
1st at the view level: showing the thing if user is authorise to 

2nd at the router level allow: the user to send that request if user if authorise to (passport.checkAuthentication)

3rd at action/controller level: allow the post to be deleted only if the (post made by user) and (user sending req to delte) same 


 <!-- now if user is signed in and and if signed user id == post . populateduser.id  
          if i dont put check delete btn is shown to every user without sign in  
           if i dont put second check then mrjohn can see this btn in anyone post 
           example mrjohn is signed in then btn is shown to his posts made not only this
           btn is available on other post also like in victor post   -->


           <% if  (locals.user && locals.user.id == post.user.id ) { %>

            <!-- //same .id handle by mongoose i could do _id aswell -->  
            <p><a href="/post/deletepost/<%=post.id%>">x</a></p>
            
            <%}%>
