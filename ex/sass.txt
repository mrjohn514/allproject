Now we are changing our way to write css in ouur websites
as if we write it as we write it will take so much time 

so there is introduction of sass and scss to help us

css
div p a {
    //css for a tag
}

div p {
//css for p tag
}

but as i have to write div p two times to give first css to anchor and then to p
but i want to give css to both p and a simultaineously wiithout repeating code again and again 
hence sass and scss came 


--------------------sass----------------
it have indentaiton format
div
   ----css--
   ----css---
   p
    ---css----
    a
     ---css---


---------------------------scss----------------
div{
    -----csss
    ------css 
    p{
     ----css
     --css
      a{
      ---css
      ----csss

      }

    }

}




/////////////////////////////////explaantion///////////////////////

so we are writiing our code in scss and whenever our server starts our middleware npm package will
converted it into css 
whenever our views reference to stylesheet they will reference to css not scss because  this is the file that 
will served to browse as browser only understand css





-------------setting up scss---------------



step 1 installing in project using command npm install node-sass-middleware

step 2 requring the module in index.js
const sasaMiddleware =require(node-sass-middleware)


---now where i have to use this sasaMiddleware firstly i have to set the settings descrived in 
documentation 

we will put it just before server is starting becaue i need those files to be precompiled before the server 
starts as  whenever my template ask for it these precompiled files will be given back

//whenver u are running srver and reaching a page it converts sccss into css and then links it to my viws
//

step 3 app.use(sasaMiddleware({
src: './assets/scss',                   //from whre do i pick up the scss files to convert into css

dest: './assets/css',                 //where do i have to put the converted scss filees(ie css files)

//debug mode is basically whatever info u see while server is running in terminal 
//do i want to display some errors that are there in file during compilation when they are not able to convert scss file to css 
debug: true,                  

outputstyle:'extended',


// where should my server look for css files by default it is looking into css folder in assets but now
//we are using the middleware we have to explicitly tell here
prefix:  '/css'


}));


upto this the file created in scss folder will convert to css and placed in css and 
also result of css will appende in page 

for example i creted profile.scss  wiht backgroundcolor: red;
now when the server starts and userprofile page is renders it rendered with red colro background
and if i check css folder there is afile with profile.css that is converted from profile.scss to profile.css






----------------------what is done--------------------
created new home page and added controler,route and views
added the sccss for home 

then created profile page 
and added sccss for profile page

changed some routes like if u login u directyly goes to profile page
