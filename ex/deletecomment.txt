step 1 create action/controlller for deleting comment

module.exports.deletecomment=function(req,res){

//finding if comment existed in database by passing the comment id received in string params to query

Comment.findById(req.params.id,function(err,comment){
if(err){console.log("erro finding cmtn");return}

//if comment found then is user authorise to delete comment or not 
//checking  founded comment user id(comment.user) == signed in user id (req.user.id)

if(comment.user== req.user.id){
comment.remove();
return res.redirect('/');
}
else
{
    return res.redirect('/');
}


});
}


step 2 set the route for the above controlller

router.get('/deletecomment/:id',passport.checkAuthentication,commentController.deletecomment);




step 3: 3 level checks as in post deletion 
adding delete btn in views and only availbe to authorised user 

<!-- 
             similar to post if user is signed in and also the signed in user id (local.user.id) must be equal
             to  received comments in post.comment[{ now populated}] (comment.user.id) 
             this tells to show x onlly on those comments which are made by signed in user -->


              <% if (locals.user && locals.user.id ==comment.user.id){  %>
                
              <p><a href="/comment/deletecomment/<%=comment.id%>">x</a></p>  
              <%}%>
