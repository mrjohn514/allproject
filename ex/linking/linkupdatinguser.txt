step 1:now we also want to show all the users on home page so we will pass the users form the 
home controller to our views like we had pssed posts
      .exec(function(err,posts){            

    User.find({},function(err,users){               //finding all the user in User collection
 
      return res.render('home_page',{
        title:'home',
        posts:posts,
        all_users:users                          //passing users found from User colleciton to views
        });

    })     

})



step 2: we added list of user in home ejs
<section id="user-friends">
<h2>friends</h2>
<% for (u of all_users) {%>

<!-- //link to the profile of user -->
 <p><a href="/user/userprofile/<%=u.id%>"></a> </p>   

<%}%>
</section>


step 3 now as we have change route in a we have to goto user routes and update profile route
router.get('/userprofile/:id',passport.checkAuthentication,userController.profile); in user.js in routes




step 4:now as we have updated route we have to update profile action in userController.js
module.exports.profile=function(req,res)
{
    console.log(req.session);
    console.log(req.user);
   

    User.findById(req.params.id,function(err,user){          //finding user by id received when someon click links in homepage 
        return res.render('user_profile',{
            title:'profile',
            //now here i cant name the key user as user named key already in locals
           profile_user:user 

        })

    })
}




//what all_users is doing we are psiing all the users present in User collection to views through this all_users

//now we put all_user.name in anchor tag  and id in route in whcih sending the id of user who clicked the link
<% for (u of all_users) {%>

<!-- //link to the profile of user -->
 <p><a href="/user/userprofile/<%=u.id%>">u.name</a> </p>   

<%}%>


//now associating this route with profile controller  in step 3 
and here finding the only user whose id matched to the one who clicked the link 

and this found usre is mapped to profile_user  profile_user:user found 

then sending this to use in profile views to show the details fo founded user by using profile_user in user_profle.ejs



step 5 using profile_user info in views that is in user_profile ejs
<section >
    <div class="content"> 
  <p><%=profile_user.name%></p>
  <p><%=profile_user.email%></p> 

    </div>
</section>


///////////////////////////some other exp///////////////////
-------------able to view victor profile without signin basicalllyy john is logged in and when he clicked
victor link in friend he is directed to profile of victor previously we are only allowed to view profile
if user is logged in because we are checking in route  passport.checkAuthentication;
router.get('/userprofile',passport.checkAuthentication,userController.profile);

->now this is also working if iam not logged and click on freinds links iam redirected to signin page 
///////////////////////////some other exp///////////////////



stpe 6 also providing update form in user profile to update their name and emails
    <div class="content"> 
    
     <!-- here we are not checking if(locals.user) becaues it is sure user cant view his profile page
     without login as we have added in passport.checkaAuthenticaiton chek so we know if user is in profile
     he is loged in 
    -->
              
        <% if(user.id==profile_user.id){%>
  <!-- if user matches i will show form for updation -->

       <form action="/user/updateuser/<%=profile_user.id%>" method="post">
           <!-- value attribute will have the current user name,email value who is logged in showing in fields   -->
          <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="entername" value="<%=profile_user.name%>" required >  
          <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="email" value="<%=profile_user.email%>" required >
          <input type="submit" value="update">

       </form>


            <%}else {%>
 <!-- otherwise onlu info -->

        <p><%=profile_user.name%></p>
        <p><%=profile_user.email%></p>
        <%}%>

    </div>


    step 7 : creating action or controller for submitting form in userController
module.exports.updateuser= function(req,res){

//checking if user is authorise to make update requesting 
//basically signed user == sending update req user 
if(req.user.id==req.params.id)
{
    // req.body is same as it= {name:req.body.name,email:req.body.email}  so instead of writing this req.body
User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id,req.body,function(err,user){
if(err){console.log("errrrrrr");return}
return res.redirect('/');

})       
}

else{
    return res.status(401).send('unauthorise');       //http statuus codes 
}
}


step 8 creating route for the above controller 
router.post('/updateprofile/:id',passport.checkAuthentication,userController.updateuser);


step 9 improving scss
